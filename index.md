# John George's Technical Writing Portfolio
## Technical Writer

My name is John, and I'm a self-motivated and enthusiastic technical writer with a diverse background with experience in enterprise software, SaaS, cloud-based integrated platforms (iPaas), mainframe, commercial, payroll, HR, security, and telecommunications.

I'm a proven leader, mentor, critical thinker, problem solver, and decision maker. I'm known for "going above and beyond" and "getting the job done." I'm able to step in, quickly analyze and understand challenges and pain points, and add value to drive customer success. I consistently experiment with new and innovative ways to improve the learning experience for users.

I have a successful track record in technical writing, editing, leadership, mentorship, project management, execution, and delivery while meeting challenging deadlines. Results include improved customer success and satisfaction, reduced support costs, and improved product perception.

If you think my background and experience would be a good match for your organization, Iâ€™d love to hear from you.
