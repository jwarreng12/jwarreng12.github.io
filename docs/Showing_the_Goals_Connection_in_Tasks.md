# Showing the Goals Connection in Tasks
You can tie your work tracked in Tasks to the Goals tool to show the direct impact of your work on department and company goals. Consistent naming conventions help others to quickly understand your activities but also allow for easy searching when connecting Tasks to the Goals tool.
The Tasks tool has a Plugin that allows you to show connections to Goals inside of each task.
