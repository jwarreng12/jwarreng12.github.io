# Technical Writing Samples

## Boomi
As a Senior Technical Writer, I wrote engineering documentation for application connectors (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.) and technology connectors (HTTP, LDAP, etc.) connecting and transforming data between applications across cloud and hybrid IT environments. Additionally, I wrote engineering documentation for building connectors using the Connector Software Development Kit (SDK).

Here are a few samples of documentation I wrote at Boomi:

### Tutorial: Building a custom connector
I wrote the [Tutorial: Building a custom connector](https://help.boomi.com/bundle/connectors/page/int-Building_your_own_custom_connector.html) to help developers build a custom connector using the Boomi Connector Software Development Kit (SDK). 

### Amazon S3 REST Connector
I wrote the [Amazon S3 REST Connector documentation](https://help.boomi.com/bundle/connectors/page/r-atm-Amazon_S3_REST_connector.html) to explain how to use the Amazon S3 REST connector to simply and securely store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the Web. You can use a Boomi Integration process to upload, store, retrieve, filter, and delete object data from an Amazon S3 bucket.

### Tutorial: Building your first Integration process
I wrote the [Tutorial: Building your first Integration process](https://help.boomi.com/bundle/integration/page/int-First_Boomi_Integration_process.html) to help Boomi Users build their first Integration process and understand the power and simplicity of the Boomi Integration Platform.
