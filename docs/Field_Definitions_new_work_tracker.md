# New Work Progress Tracker
This SharePoint tracking listwas created to ensure consistent project tracking and to increase the visibility of the work we do. This also allows a centralized and uniform process for capturing our monthly work requests and completions. This will help us to automate our monthly reporting for the Product Operations reviews.
