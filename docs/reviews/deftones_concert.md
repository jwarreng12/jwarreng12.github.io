### The Deftones play to a sold-out crowd at Tucson's Rialto

Last night, The Deftones took to the stage at the Rialto Theatre as legions of fans crowded around the alternative metal band.

Starting the set off with a biting version of "Engine Number 9" off its debut album Adrenaline, The Deftones began to fuel the flames of energy within every person in attendance.

The road to Tucson started in Sacramento, Calif., where The Deftones - former high school classmates - formed. Their first album Adrenaline was released in 1995. With minimum exposure, the band toured endlessly, resulting in a massive following. With songs appearing on "The Crow: City of Angels" soundtrack, the spotlight slowly moved in the band's direction. With the successful release of their second album Around the Fur (1997) and latest album White Pony, The Deftones became a staple of MTV and had major radio play.

After three songs, it became apparent that the band was giving the audience exactly what they needed. With tracks from Around The Fur and Adrenaline, the band took purposeful pauses, until finally releasing the audience from their anticipation, with each progressing chord. Bass player Chi Cheng wasted no time thrashing about the stage with his instrument close behind.

Singer Chino Moreno made use of all of the room on stage as screams from many loving female fans could be heard coming from every direction. Running from corner to corner of the stage, Moreno sang for the fans as he knelt before them in a serenading fashion.

In the middle of the set, the band left the stage and only Moreno remained. As a mirror ball reflected bits of light on the entire crowd, Moreno performed a slow yet beautiful ballad. Singing to anyone and everyone near the stage, he was grasped by the arms of fans reaching out to touch him.

The crowd awoke with applause after Moreno outstretched his hands in a position of crucifixion before breaking into "Change" the big radio hit for the band in 2000. As the singer donned his guitar he thanked everyone for coming out for the show.

"I talked to my manager last week, and I said to him 'Take me to Tucson!'" Moreno said.

Once again the crowd cheered for the band as it played the evening's fan-favorite "Root," which turned the floor into a mass of bodies circling about. With barely enough time to keep his pants up, Moreno and the rest of the band shot straight through a block of songs without stopping.

Closing out the set, Moreno asked the crowd what they would like to hear. As final screams were let out into the microphone, the band exited the stage after playing "Lotion." As the fans cheered and yelled, the stage stayed empty. One female concert-goer was heard yelling "Chino, I love you!" After a few minutes, the band came back to the stage to play two final songs.

In the middle of the final song the band stopped and began to play Weezer's "Say it Ain't So." Raising his hands into fists, the crowd gladly responded with fists of their own. Jumping up and down, following every direction the band gave them, the crowd moved about in total chaos.

Hot and tired fans slowly began to exit from the front part of the stage, making it obvious they had taken a beating.

As the band made its final stop here in Tucson they made sure that they gave every ounce of energy they had. The band will head to South America tomorrow for a concert in Brazil but said it hopes to come back soon to experience what Arizona has to offer.
