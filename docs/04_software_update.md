## Batch Approval Enhancement

**Overview**

You now have better control over transaction posting which will assist in meeting the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and bank examiners. This option provides you with dual control of manual transactions. One person can enter the set of  transactions and then a manager can review and approve them.

Your institution can choose to implement this feature, but it is not required. This process will handle all manually keyed transactions done through the standard menu options. This includes third party transactions uploaded through overnight processing.

*Utilize GL Batch Approval*

Set this to **Yes** and transactions will go to a staging file until they are approved, which moves them into the transaction file. If you have the authority to approve your own batch the transactions will go into the GL transaction staging area where you can approve them. Only approved batches will post during End of Day processing.

>**Note:**
>If this is set to **No**, the transactions will continue to be sent to the GL transaction file.
