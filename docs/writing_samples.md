# Technical Writing Samples

Here are my technical writing samples.
## Boomi
As a Senior Technical Writer, I wrote engineering documentation for application connectors (Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.) and technology connectors (HTTP, LDAP, etc.) connecting and transforming data between applications across cloud and hybrid IT environments. Additionally, I wrote engineering documentation for building connectors using the Connector Software Development Kit (SDK).

### [Tutorial: Building a custom connector]([url](https://help.boomi.com/bundle/connectors/page/int-Building_your_own_custom_connector.html))
I wrote this tutorial to help developers build a custom connector using the Boomi Connector Software Development Kit (SDK). 

### [Amazon S3 REST Connector]([url](https://help.boomi.com/bundle/connectors/page/r-atm-Amazon_S3_REST_connector.html))
I wrote this documentation to explain how to use the Amazon S3 REST connector to simply and securely store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the Web. You can use a Boomi Integration process to upload, store, retrieve, filter, and delete object data from an Amazon S3 bucket.

### [Tutorial: Building your first Integration process]([url](https://help.boomi.com/bundle/integration/page/int-First_Boomi_Integration_process.html))
I wrote this tutorial to help Boomi Users build their first Integration process and understand the power and simplicity of the Boomi Integration Platform.
